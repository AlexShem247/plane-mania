# Plane Mania by Alexander Shemaly

Welcome to Plane Mania, a Plane Themed Endless Runner, where you play as a Pilot trying to fly to a nearby tropical island.
Go through clouds and collect items to help you fly through the skies and watch out for enemy planes trying to shoot you down.
Use your plane flying skills as well as your plane's guns to blast through enemies and collect enough points to keep your altitude high.
Watch out through - the game gets harder, the longer you fly and if you do not collect enough items in time, your plane will crash and you lose.

**Can you reach the end?**

_Available for both PC and on Mobile for Android_
